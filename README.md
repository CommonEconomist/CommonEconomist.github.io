### Replication data
* [Economic shocks and civil conflict (DPE)](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Publications/tree/master/DPE_2015)

### Replications
These are a number of studies that I have replicated as I found them interesting, or they were relevant to my own research projects (a sort of drive-by falsification). 
More information on each study and the replication effort can be found at the respective page, following the link.

### R code

* Example of [processing satellite night light data](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Rcode/tree/master/NightLights)
* Aggregate [spatial point data to grid-cell](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Rcode/blob/master/Points2Grid.R) level
* Calculating [spatial lag](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Rcode/blob/master/W.R) in time-series cross-section data
* Plotting [earthquake locations](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Rcode/blob/master/Earthquakes.R) in the past 7 days

## Mildly interesting stuff
