### Replications
Below are a number of studies that I have replicated (often the result of testing things in R or just procrastination). 
More information on each study and the replication effort can be found at the respective page. In some incidental cases I have written up the results of the replication (see links). 

* ["Mortality in Iraq associated with the 2003â€“2011 war and occupation"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/replications/tree/master/2013_Hagopian_et_al)
* ["Warming increases the risk of civil war in Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/replications/tree/master/2009_Burke_et_al) <br>
Since I re-analysed this study I devoted a whole [working paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract_id=2550228)  to it.
