### Replication data
* [Economic shocks and civil conflict (DPE)](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Research_data/tree/master/DPE_2015)

### Replications
These are a number of studies that I have replicated as I found them interesting, or they were relevant to my own research projects. 
More information on each study and replication results are given on the respective pages (following the link).

* ["Mortality in Iraq Associated with the 2003â€“2011 War and Occupation"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2013_Hagopian_et_al)
* ["Warming increases the risk of civil war in Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2009_Burke_et_al)
* ["The Legacy of Historical Conflict: Evidence from Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2014_Besley_Reynal-Querol)
* ["Modest, Secure, and Informed: Successful Development in Conflict Zones"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2013_Berman_et_al)
* ["International Commodity Prices, Growth and the Outbreak of Civil War in Sub-Saharan Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2010_Bruckner_Ciccone)
* ["Pattern in Escalations in Insurgent and Terrorist Activity"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2011_Johnson_et_al)
* ["Rising Food Prices, Food Price Volatility, and Social Unrest"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2015_Bellemare)

### Code
* Aggregate [precipitation data in R](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/R_code/blob/master/spatial_data/Precipitation.R). Script wil download precipitation data (from [NASA GPCP](ftp://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/912/bolvin/GPCP_ASCII/)), increase the resolution of the grid (2.5 to 0.5 degree), and aggregate data to country-year level for African countries. Script uses these [shapefiles](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php)
* Aggregate [spatial point data to grid-cell](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/R_code/blob/master/spatial_data/Points2Grid.R) level
* Calculating [spatial lag](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/R_code/blob/master/spatial_data/W.R) in time-series cross-section data
* Plotting [earthquake locations](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/R_code/blob/master/earth_quakes.R) in the past 7 days

## Mildly interesting stuff

* [When not running regressions](http://veloviewer.com/athlete/2135375/). Current [Eddington number](http://triathlete-europe.competitor.com/2011/04/18/measuring-bike-miles-eddington-number) (or h-index if you want) is **80**.
* [Import substitution in the Premier League](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/upshot/globalization-under-attack-on-the-soccer-field.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&abt=0002&abg=1)
* [Accidental aRt](http://accidental-art.tumblr.com/) 
* Useful research resources 
 * [LaTeX table generator](http://truben.no/latex/table/)
 * [Code and data for the social sciences](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/CodeAndData.pdf)
 * [Graphs instead of tables](http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php) (Also [relevant](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/))
 * [CSV fingerprint](http://setosa.io/csv-fingerprint/)
