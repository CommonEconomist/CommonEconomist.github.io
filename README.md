### Data and code

[R-script](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Africa-precipitation/blob/master/precipitation.R) for downloading rainfall data (from [NASA GPCP](ftp://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/912/bolvin/GPCP_ASCII/)), increasing resolution (2.5 to 0.5 degree), and aggregating data to country-year level. Script uses these [shapefiles](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php)

### Mildly interesting 

* Some personal things: [Cycling](http://veloviewer.com/athlete/2135375/), [Photography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/svwscoop/), [Quasi-random stuff](http://iv2sls.tumblr.com/)
* Some websites I frequent: [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Inner Ring](http://inrng.com/), [War is Boring](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/), [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/).
* People with interesting work: [Andrew Gelman](http://andrewgelman.com/), [Elias Papaioannou](https://sites.google.com/site/papaioannouelias/)
* LaTeX resources: [table generator](http://truben.no/latex/table/),[equation editor](http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php), and an overview of various [beamer themes](http://www.hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/).
* Some useful tips for research: [code and data for the social sciences](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/CodeAndData.pdf), [graphs instead of tables](http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php), and [how to give a presentation](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/applied_micro_slides.pdf).
