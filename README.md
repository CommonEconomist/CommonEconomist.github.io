### Data and code

[R-script](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Africa-precipitation/blob/master/precipitation.R) for downloading rainfall data (from [NASA GPCP](ftp://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/912/bolvin/GPCP_ASCII/)), increasing resolution (2.5 to 0.5 degree), and aggregating data to country-year level. Script uses these [shapefiles](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php)
