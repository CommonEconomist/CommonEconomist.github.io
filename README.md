* [A spatial analysis of the effect of foreign aid in conflict areas](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2450867)
* [Food imports, international prices, and violence in Africa](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2418973)

### Research projects

* Addressing the causes of civil strife in Uganda: The short-term effects of foreign aid
* Modeling civil unrest dynamics

### Replication data
* [Economic shocks and civil conflict (DPE)](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/DPE_Shocks_and_Conflict_Onset)

### Replications
Replication results for a number of studies that are part of my own project or that I replicated out of interest.
See the respective websites for more information.
* ["Mortality in Iraq Associated with the 2003â€“2011 War and Occupation"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2013_Hagopian_et_al)
* ["Warming increases the risk of civil war in Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2009_Burke_et_al)
* ["The Legacy of Historical Conflict: Evidence from Africa"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2014_Besley_Reynal-Querol)
* ["Modest, Secure, and Informed: Successful Development in Conflict Zones"](https://github.com/CommonEconomist/Replications/tree/master/2013_Berman_et_al)

### Code
* Aggregate [precipitation data in R](https://gist.github.com/01da48de3a0d97074890.git). Script wil download precipitation data (from [NASA GPCP](ftp://rsd.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/912/bolvin/GPCP_ASCII/)), increase the resolution of the grid (2.5 to 0.5 degree), and aggregate data to country-year level for African countries. Script uses these [shapefiles](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php)
* Calculating [spatial lag](https://gist.github.com/CommonEconomist/2de0ead3ada2c2f5be70) in time-series cross-section data
* Plotting [earthquake locations](https://gist.github.com/CommonEconomist/b1ad8c16c2282d6c7896) in the past 7 days
* Aggregate [spatial points data to grid-cell](https://gist.github.com/CommonEconomist/df037c06d4e1c0d637fc) level

## Mildly interesting stuff

* [When not running regressions](http://veloviewer.com/athlete/2135375/) (Current [Eddington](http://triathlete-europe.competitor.com/2011/04/18/measuring-bike-miles-eddington-number) number: 74)
* Useful research resources 
 * [LaTeX table generator](http://truben.no/latex/table/)
 * [Code and data for the social sciences](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/jesse.shapiro/research/CodeAndData.pdf)
 * [Graphs instead of tables](http://tables2graphs.com/doku.php)
 * [CSV fingerprint](http://setosa.io/csv-fingerprint/)
