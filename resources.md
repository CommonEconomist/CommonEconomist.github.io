*First posted 10 August 2018; last revised 10 August 2018*<br>

This reference pager collects papers which provide a good overview of current academic research on conflict. In the future I will probably add sections on other topics I work on as well as on econometrics. Naturally this paper reflects my interests and there is a substantial selection bias, although I try to list what is currently the state-of-the-art, along with some seminal papers.
Current list is still under revision so I might add or remove articles. <br>

Suggestions are welcome.
