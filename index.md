I am an applied econometrist.
My research lies at the intersection of political economy and development economics. 
In particular, my studies focus on the determinants and consequences of violent armed conflict. 
Most of my work centers on Africa. 
In addition some of my projects address universal patterns in war severity. 

My current research is on:

1. Trade and war in colonial and post-colonial Africa
2. The effect of refugee camps on i) environmental degradation and ii) health outcomes
